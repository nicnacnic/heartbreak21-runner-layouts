## How To Use
Note that all the .png's and positions are assuming your canvas size is 1280x720. If your canvas size is not 1280x720, please change it.

1) Download this repo.
2) Import the selected layout .png into OBS.
3) Move it to the top of the source list. (Layout > Game > Cam)
4) View `Layout Positions.md` for the exact position of your game/camera.
5) In OBS, right-click your game/camera, then click `Transform` and `Edit Transform...`. You can also use `Ctrl + E`.
6) Using `Layout Positions.md`, change the position and size of your game/camera. Don't touch the other controls!
7) Make sure your game and camera are in the correct position and aren't being hidden by the layout .png.
8) You're done!
